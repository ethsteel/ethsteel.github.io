The STEEL Team (Specifications and Testing for the Ethereum Execution Layer) is an Ethereum Foundation team in [Protocol](https://protocol.ethereum.foundation/) that is responsible for maintaining Ethereum's Execution Layer [specifications](https://ethereum.github.io/execution-specs/src/ethereum/osaka/blocks.py.html), [consensus tests](https://eest.ethereum.org/main/tests/) and EVM [benchmark tests](https://eest.ethereum.org/main/tests/benchmark/).

<br/>

Our main focus is ensuring **accurate specifications and comprehensive testing coverage** for the next [Ethereum hard fork](https://forkcast.org/). Alongside this work, we aim to **accelerate Ethereum development** by supporting researchers to implement specifications and tests proposed for subsequent forks and contribute to the effort to [**Scale the L1**](https://protocol.ethereum.foundation/) by providing [computational- and state-intensive test cases](https://eest.ethereum.org/main/tests/benchmark/) that help client teams prepare for pathological scenarios and support Ethereum safely raise the block gas limit.

<br/>

As such, our work is a deeply collaborative effort with many other teams in EF Protocol (such as Prototyping, [ethPandaOps](https://ethpandaops.io/), [Geth](https://geth.ethereum.org/), [Stateless Consensus](https://stateless.fyi/), zkEVM and [Security](https://security.ethereum.org/)), the Mainnet Execution Layer client teams (e.g., Geth, Nethermind, Besu, Erigon, Reth) and other independent Ethereum researchers.

<br/>

One of our major goals is to empower these Ethereum core developers to expedite Ethereum development. We aim to enable:

- **Researchers** by providing the best tooling to quickly prototype and verify specifications, facilitating the EIP inclusion process for future forks and enabling parallel development.
- **Client Developers** by providing new test formats and frameworks in order to quickly verify client functionality and easily debug problems when they arise.

<br/>

We maintain the [ethereum/execution-specs](https://github.com/ethereum/execution-specs) and [ethereum/execution-spec-tests](https://github.com/ethereum/execution-spec-tests) repositories. You can learn more about our work on the [responsibilities page](../../responsibilities/) or from our [previous presentations](https://github.com/ethsteel/presentations/blob/main/README.md).
