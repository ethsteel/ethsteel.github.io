The **STEEL Team** (Specifications and Testing for the Ethereum Execution Layer) is an [Ethereum Foundation Protocol](https://protocol.ethereum.foundation/) team focused on **maintaining the specifications and tests for Ethereum‚Äôs Execution Layer**.  

Our work is centered around two main projects:  

- **EELS üìê** - the [Ethereum Execution Layer Specs](https://github.com/ethereum/execution-specs), written in executable Python to serve as both documentation and a reference implementation.  
- **EEST üß™** - the [Ethereum Execution Spec Tests](https://github.com/ethereum/execution-spec-tests), which generate and release consensus and benchmarking test vectors for client teams.  

Together, these projects ensure that **Execution Layer upgrades are clearly specified, sufficiently tested, and safe for Mainnet deployment**.  

## Core Responsibilities

### Specifications (EELS üìê)

- Maintain the Execution Layer specification as executable Python code.
- Help prototype and document proposed EIPs.
- Publish spec snapshot releases to highlight differences between forks (e.g., [MODEXP changes in Osaka](https://ethereum.github.io/execution-specs/diffs/prague/osaka/vm/precompiled_contracts/modexp.py.html)).
- Provide the reference EVM used to generate consensus tests for execution layer client teams.

### Tests (EEST üß™)

- Maintain Python test cases for EIPs and ‚ÄúScale the L1‚Äù efforts.
- Generate and continuously deliver reference test case releases for Execution Layer clients.
- Provide benchmarking and pathological test cases to help clients prepare for stress scenarios.
- Assist client teams in debugging failures and feed findings back into specs and tests.

### Tooling ‚öôÔ∏è

### Libraries

- [ethereum/ethereum-types](https://github.com/ethereum/ethereum-types) - types used by Ethereum.
- [ethereum/ethereum-rlp](https://github.com/ethereum/ethereum-rlp) - Recursive-length prefix (RLP) serialization as used by the Ethereum Specification.
- [ethereum/web3.py](https://github.com/ethereum/web3.py) - A python interface for interacting with the Ethereum blockchain and ecosystem.

### Client Test Frameworks

We maintain several system-test frameworks to help test Execution Layer Clients:

- **[Consume](https://eest.ethereum.org/main/running_tests/consume/)** - a family of [Hive](https://github.com/ethereum/hive) simulators that execute EEST test vectors against clients by feeding blocks via RLP (upon startup) or the Engine API.
- **[Execute](https://eest.ethereum.org/main/running_tests/execute/)** - a framework for running EEST test vectors on live networks or as a Hive simulator, ensuring fixture compatibility across both simulated and real environments.

See the EEST docs [on running tests for an overview and comparison](https://eest.ethereum.org/main/running_tests/running/) of all Hive simulators and frameworks.

### Other Tooling

- **[docc](https://github.com/SamWilsn/docc)** - A documentation creation tool for Python with a specific focus on markdown and extensibility.
- **[eth-tester](https://github.com/ethereum/eth-tester)** - A tool suite for testing ethereum applications.
- **[Blobber](https://github.com/marioevz/blobber)** - A live-network tool for testing blob transaction propagation across clients.  
- **[`gentest`](https://github.com/ethereum/execution-spec-tests)** - A utility that generates Python test cases directly from a Mainnet or devnet transaction hash, useful for reproducing real-world scenarios in the EEST framework.  

<!-- implementation not complete enough to list yet:
- **[eest-fuzz](https://github.com/SamWilsn/eest-fuzz) (WIP)** - Library and tools for (de)structuring EEST data types from arbitrary byte streams.
-->

## Collaboration

Our work is very collaborative in nature, we work closely with:  

- **Researchers & EIP Authors** - to ensure proposals are clear, sufficient, and correct before inclusion.  
- **Client Developers** - to verify implementations, provide debugging support, and ensure readiness before forks.  
- **Security Researchers** - to harden specifications and tests against ambiguous or unsafe behavior.  

## Current Focus

- **[Fusaka hard fork](https://forkcast.org/upgrade/fusaka)** - finalizing tests and specs in preparation for the Fusaka hard fork, scheduled for Nov 2025.
- **[Glamsterdam hard fork](https://forkcast.org/upgrade/glamsterdam)** - contributing to [Block-Level Access List](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-7928) (BAL) specs and tests.
- **Scale the L1** - generating computational- and state-intensive test cases to safely raise the block gas limit and test zkEVMs.
- **Test Corpus Unification** - enabling test vector generation from the corpus of tests from `ethereum/tests` (the predecessor to EEST) using EEST's test framework. The aim is to provide clients with a single source of consensus tests and deprecate the previous test framework [ethereum/retesteth](https://github.com/ethereum/retesteth).
- **The Weld** - moving the test cases and frameworks from [ethereum/execution-spec-test](https://github.com/ethereum/execution-spec-tests) to [ethereum/execution-specs](https://github.com/ethereum/execution-specs) in order to provide a better developer experience for specification and test developers.
